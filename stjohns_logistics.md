### Getting Around

Please note that Uber and Lyft are not available in St. John's, but [City Wide Taxi](https://citywidetaxi.ca/) and [Jiffy Cabs](https://jiffycabs.net/) have developed their own Uber-like apps. You can find more information on public transportation and taxi services on the [Getting Around section of the St. John's website](https://www.stjohns.ca/en/living-in-st-johns/getting-around-st-john_s.aspx#Drive). Flat rates from the airport to certain hotels are [listed here](https://stjohnsairport.com/to-from-airport/ground-transportation/taxis/).

## Accommodations

### Hotels

You are responsible for arranging your own accommodation in St. John's. Some suggested accommodations in the St. John's city centre are listed below. Please note that these hotels are close to dining, but are **not walking distance** from the workshop venue (approx. 50 minutes' walk).

* [Sheraton Hotel](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/yytsi-sheraton-hotel-newfoundland/overview/)
* [Alt Hotel](https://www.germainhotels.com/en/alt-hotel/st-johns)

* [Premiere Suites](https://premieresuites.com/furnished-apartments/st--john-s/signal-hill-gate/) - guests attending MUN events may be eligible for discounted rates

### University Residences

The University also offers accommodation in its student residences, including Macpherson College and Paton College. These rooms are significantly closer to the workshop venue and the airport than the above hotels, but are farther from the city centre.
