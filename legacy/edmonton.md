## Transportation To/From Edmonton  
### By Air: Edmonton International Airport (YEG)  
Edmonton International Airport (YEG) is located 26 km south of downtown Edmonton.  

[Edmonton Transit's Route 747 bus](https://www.edmonton.ca/ets/edmonton-international-airport) runs from YEG to Century Park Transit Centre 7 days a week from 4:10am to 12:30am every 30-60 minutes. Once it reaches Century Park Transit Centre, you can transfer directly to the LRT (subway) Capital line and exit at the Health Sciences/Jubilee or University stations. Be aware that University Station is about a 10-15 minute walk from hotels like Lister Hall and Campus Tower.

YEG has several taxi/limousine partner companies. Fare to downtown Edmonton is a flat rate of $62 for taxis and $71 for limos. [You can find more information here.](https://flyeia.com/parking-transportation/taxis-limos-rideshares/)  

Rideshare services like Uber and Lyft are also available. Rates are dynamically priced.
