## Transportation To/From Montréal  

### By Air  

#### Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport (YUL)  

Air Canada and many US carriers provide direct flights to Montreal. The Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport is located just outside of the city about 20 km from downtown Montreal, and is readily accessible. 

To get to IRCM from YUL:  

* Public transit: Société de transport de Montréal (STM), Montreal's public transit operates the [747 Montreal-Trudeau/Downtown](https://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/bus/shuttle/747-yul-montreal-trudeau-airport-downtown-shuttle) shuttle which connects into the rest of Montreal’s transit system. The 747 operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. For current fares, schedules, and transit planning please visit: http://www.stm.info/en. 

* Limousine/Taxi service: Taxis are also a quick and easy way to get to and from Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport. Taxis are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Taxis charge a metered rate based on time and distance. The approximate fare to downtown Montreal is $40-$50. No reservations are required. 

### By Car  

This will of course depend on where you are driving from. Parking is very limited around the IRCM at this time: [more information is available here](https://www.ircm.qc.ca/en/information-refection-work).
