## Transportation To/From Vancouver

### By Air  
Air Canada and many US carriers provide direct flights to Vancouver. Vancouver airport is located south of the city about 12 km from downtown Vancouver, and is readily accessible. 

To get to Langara College from YVR:  

* Public transit: take the Canada Line train from Sea Island Centre in YVR to Langara-49th Avenue station. From there, it is a 5 minute walk. 

* Limousine/Taxi service: Taxis are also a quick and easy way to get to and from Vancouver International Airport and cost about $28.

* Ridehares: Lyft, Uber, and KABU are authorized rideshare providers. Fares vary based on a variety of factors.

### By Car
This will of course depend on where you are driving from. [Parking information is available here.](https://langara.ca/campus-facilities/parking-transportation/parking)

## Accommodations

You are responsible for arranging your own accommodation. There are accommodations nearby, though most that are very close are AirBnBs/vacation rentals. A bit further out, there are hotels like [2400 Motel](https://www.google.com/travel/search?ts=CAESCgoCCAMKAggDEAAaWgo8EjgyJTB4NTQ4Njc0NmY0MTI1NjNmNzoweDM2NjA2ZDIyMTUwOWZkZmU6D0xhbmdhcmEgQ29sbGVnZRoAEhoSFAoHCOkPEAsYAhIHCOkPEAsYAxgBMgIQACoNCgk6A0NBRFoCEA0aAA&qs=CAEyJkNoZ0lvUFNNeG9LZHM0S3pBUm9MTDJjdk1YUnJObDgxYlhRUUFROAZIAFpiCAEyXqoBWwoJL20vMDZjMXg0EAEqCiIGaG90ZWxzKAAyHxABIhvXFfd25HiI280I_0gsPVB67at7rT0iWtafxM8yHxACIhtob3RlbHMgbmVhciBsYW5nYXJhIGNvbGxlZ2U&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link_btn&utm_source=htls) and airport hotels including the [Best Western](https://www.google.com/travel/search?ts=CAESCgoCCAMKAggDEAAahAEKZBI4MiUweDU0ODY3NDZmNDEyNTYzZjc6MHgzNjYwNmQyMjE1MDlmZGZlOg9MYW5nYXJhIENvbGxlZ2UaKAoSCfz16Fy4kkhAEeui7lGTyl7AEhIJxdyjqLmYSEAR66LucUrGXsASHBIUCgcI6Q8QCxgCEgcI6Q8QCxgDGAEyBAgAEAAqCQoFOgNDQUQaAA&qs=CAEyJ0Noa0loWW1CNXNPVjdjZzlHZzB2Wnk4eE1YSmZhemRyZG01c0VBRTgGSABaYggBMl6qAVsKCS9tLzA2YzF4NBABKgoiBmhvdGVscygAMh8QASIb1xX3duR4iNvNCP9ILD1Qeu2re609IlrWn8TPMh8QAiIbaG90ZWxzIG5lYXIgbGFuZ2FyYSBjb2xsZWdl&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link_btn&utm_source=htls).
